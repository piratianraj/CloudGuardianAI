## 7. Data Sources & Simulation

* **Primary Sources (AWS Example):**
    * **AWS CloudTrail:** API call activity (user, role, service, actions, source IP). Crucial for IAM-related threats, unusual provisioning, policy changes.
    * **VPC Flow Logs:** Network traffic metadata (source/dest IP, port, protocol, bytes, action). Essential for network reconnaissance, data exfiltration, C&C communication detection.
    * **AWS GuardDuty Findings (Optional):** Use existing findings as labeled data or input for correlation.
    * **Kubernetes Audit Logs (Optional, if using EKS/Self-managed K8s):** Container activity, API server requests. Useful for container escapes, privilege escalation within K8s.
* **Simulation Strategy:**
    * **Normal Baseline:** Generate logs representing typical user/application activity (requires defining "normal" usage patterns). Use cloud SDKs to perform routine actions.
    * **Attack Simulation:** Use frameworks like `Stratus Red Team`, `Pacu`, or manually script actions mimicking MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud TTPs. Examples:
        * *Credential Access:* Simulate unusual AssumeRole activity, brute-force login attempts (failed CloudTrail logins).
        * *Discovery:* Simulate excessive `List*`, `Describe*`, `Get*` API calls.
        * *Lateral Movement:* Simulate EC2 instance accessing unusual services or other instances.
        * *Exfiltration:* Simulate large data transfers out via S3 or unusual network connections in VPC Flow Logs.
        * *Persistence:* Simulate creation of new IAM users/roles, Lambda backdoors.
        * *Defense Evasion:* Simulate stopping CloudTrail logging, modifying security group rules.
    * **Data Labeling:** Carefully label simulated attack logs for supervised learning or evaluation.

## 8. Feature Engineering

* **CloudTrail:**
    * Frequency analysis (API calls per user/role/IP)
    * Time-based features (time of day, day of week anomalies)
    * Sessionization of user activity
    * API call sequences/patterns
    * Geographical location analysis (based on source IP)
    * Error code analysis
* **VPC Flow Logs:**
    * Connection volume (bytes/packets sent/received)
    * Connection duration
    * Number of unique ports/IPs contacted
    * Ratio of inbound/outbound traffic
    * Detection of connections to known malicious IPs (requires Threat Intel feed)
    * Periodicity/beaconing detection
* **General:** Combine features across log sources for richer context (e.g., API call followed by specific network traffic).

## 9. Machine Learning Models

* **Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised/Semi-supervised):**
    * **Isolation Forest:** Good for high-dimensional data, efficient. Detects outliers based on ease of isolation.
    * **Autoencoders (Neural Network):** Learns a compressed representation of "normal" data. High reconstruction error indicates anomaly. Good for complex patterns.
    * **One-Class SVM:** Finds a boundary around normal data points.
* **Sequence Analysis (for CloudTrail/API call patterns):**
    * **LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network):** Models temporal dependencies in sequences of API calls to detect unusual progressions.
    * **Transformers:** Potentially more powerful for capturing long-range dependencies in activity sequences.
* **Classification (Supervised - requires labeled attack data):**
    * **XGBoost/LightGBM:** Powerful gradient boosting methods, often high performance.
    * **Random Forest:** Ensemble method, robust.
    * **Feedforward Neural Network:** For classifying events based on engineered features.
* **Graph-Based Analysis (Optional, Advanced):**
    * **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Model relationships between entities (users, roles, instances, IPs) to detect community anomalies or suspicious links.
    * **Graph Representation Learning:** Convert cloud infrastructure and activity into graph structures where nodes represent entities (users, roles, instances, services) and edges represent interactions or relationships.
    * **Graph Algorithms:** Apply centrality measures, community detection, and path analysis to identify unusual access patterns or privilege escalation paths.
    * **Temporal Graph Analysis:** Track how entity relationships evolve over time to detect gradual privilege accumulation or unusual relationship formations.
    * **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Combine cloud activity data with security knowledge graphs to provide context-aware threat detection.

## 10. Threat Detection Scenarios (Examples)

1.  **Compromised IAM Credentials:** Unusual login times/locations, rapid API calls from a single user/role, privilege escalation attempts.
2.  **Anomalous API Activity:** Usage of dangerous or infrequent APIs, sequences of API calls indicative of reconnaissance or exploitation.
3.  **Data Exfiltration Attempts:** Large outbound transfers in VPC Flow Logs, unusual S3 access patterns (e.g., listing many buckets then downloading).
4.  **Network Scanning/Reconnaissance:** Horizontal/vertical port scanning detected in VPC Flow Logs.
5.  **Defense Evasion:** CloudTrail logging disabled, security group rules significantly altered.
6.  **Container Security (if K8s logs included):** Anomalous exec commands in pods, suspicious network traffic from pods, attempts to access host resources.
7.  **Cloud Service Misconfiguration:** Detection of overly permissive IAM policies or security groups being created (via CloudTrail analysis).

## 11. Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy:** Overall correctness (use with caution on imbalanced datasets).
* **Precision:** Of the detected alerts, how many were actual threats? (Minimize False Positives). `TP / (TP + FP)`
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** Of the actual threats, how many were detected? (Minimize False Negatives). `TP / (TP + FN)`
* **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. Good for imbalanced data. `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`
* **AUC-ROC:** Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Measures model's ability to distinguish between classes across different thresholds.
* **False Positive Rate (FPR):** `FP / (FP + TN)` - Critical for operational usability.

## 12. Visualization & Alerting

* **Dashboard:**
    * Use Streamlit, Plotly/Dash, or Kibana.
    * Display summary statistics (events processed, anomalies detected).
    * List recent high-priority alerts with key details (timestamp, user/IP, detected scenario, confidence score).
    * Visualize anomaly scores over time.
    * (Optional) Network graph visualization for VPC Flow Log anomalies.
* **Alerting (Simulated):**
    * Generate structured output (e.g., JSON) for events exceeding a defined risk threshold.
    * Log alerts to a file or console output.

## 13. Potential Challenges

* **Data Quality & Volume:** Handling large, potentially noisy log data.
* **Realistic Simulation:** Creating truly representative normal and attack data is difficult.
* **Feature Engineering:** Identifying the most predictive features requires domain expertise.
* **Model Tuning:** Finding optimal hyperparameters for ML models.
* **High False Positive Rate:** Anomaly detection often produces many false positives; tuning is critical.
* **Concept Drift:** Real-world patterns change over time; models may need retraining (out of scope for initial project but important context).
* **Scalability:** Ensuring processing can handle significant log volumes (relevant if using Spark, less so for smaller simulations).
